## Description
_A team effort in using HTML, CSS, Javascript, & jQuery. Combat Management System is a fighting game where two players choose their individual fighters whose stat points are preallocated into different attributes, and then take turns attacking. There are three choices on your turn: Attack, Defend, and Special. Attack will roll a die and deal damage accordingly. Special will use up one of three special points and deal 2x damage to the opposing character. Defend will increase your defense rating when the opposing player next attacks, as well as give you one extra special point (You may not have more than three). The game ends when one characters HP reaches 0!_
